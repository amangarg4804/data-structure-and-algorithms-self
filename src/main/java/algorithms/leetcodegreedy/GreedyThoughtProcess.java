    //Example 1
    // Let's say you go to a store and you are allowed to choose 3 items out of 5 for free.
    // Items are prices a 10, 5, 20, 15, 30. WHich 3 items will you choose?
    // You will act greedy and choose the 3 items with highest price (20, 15, 30)
    // We can sort the array and take 3 items from the end

    // Example 2
    // you are a wine seller with 4 wine bottles priced at 5, 50, 40, 20
    // as the wine age, price increases. First year, price is multiplied by 1, 2nd year by 2, 3rd year by 3 and 4th year by 4
    // Which wine will you sell in which year to maximize profit?
    // You will act greedy and sell the wine with the smallest price in first year and the largest price in 4th year
    // So answer will be 5,20, 40, 50
    // Just sort the array


    // Greedy problems use Searching, sorting and priority Queues
