//You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
//
//On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time.
// However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
//
//Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
//
//Example 1:
//Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
//Output: 7
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
//Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.

//Example 2:
//Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
//Total profit is 4.

import java.util.Arrays;

//Example 3:
//Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
//Output: 0
//Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.
//
//
//Constraints:
//1 <= prices.length <= 3 * 104
//0 <= prices[i] <= 104
